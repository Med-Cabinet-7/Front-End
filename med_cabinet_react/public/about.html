        <div class="disclaimer">
            FDA Disclaimer:
            <br>
            <br>FDA has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of the drug substance cannabidiol (CBD) for
            the
            treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age
            and older. That means FDA has concluded that this particular drug product is safe and effective for its
            intended use.
            <br>
            <br>The agency also has approved Marinol and Syndros for therapeutic uses in the United States, including
            for
            nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy and for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in
            AIDS patients. Marinol and Syndros include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9-
            tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is considered the psychoactive intoxicating component of cannabis (i.e.,
            the component responsible for the “high” people may experience from using cannabis). Another FDA-approved
            drug, Cesamet, contains the active ingredient nabilone, which has a chemical structure similar to THC and is
            synthetically derived. Cesamet, like dronabinol-containing products, is indicated for nausea associated with
            cancer chemotherapy.
            <br>
            <br>FDA is aware that unapproved cannabis and/or unapproved cannabis-derived products are being used to
            treat a
            number of medical conditions including, AIDS wasting, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, spasticity associated with
            multiple sclerosis, and cancer and chemotherapy-induced nausea. Caregivers and patients can be confident
            that FDA-approved drugs have been carefully evaluated for safety, efficacy, and quality, and are monitored
            by the FDA once they are on the market. However, the use of unapproved cannabis and cannabis-derived
            products can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, including serious safety risks. Also, there has
            been no FDA review of data from rigorous clinical trials to support that these unapproved products are safe
            and efficacious for the various therapeutic uses for which they are being used.
            <br>
            <br>FDA understands the need to develop therapies for patients with unmet medical needs, and does everything
            it
            can to facilitate this process. FDA has programs such as Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated
            Approval and Priority Review that are designed to facilitate the development of and expedite the approval of
            drug products. In addition, the FDA’s expanded access (sometimes called “compassionate use”) statutory and
            regulatory provisions are designed to facilitate the availability of investigational products to patients
            with serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy
            available, either because the patients have exhausted treatment with or are intolerant of approved
            therapies, or when the patients are not eligible for an ongoing clinical trial. Through these programs and
            the drug approval process, FDA supports sound, scientifically-based research into the medicinal uses of drug
            products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds and will continue to work with companies
            interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market.
