            <div class="info">What What springs to your mind when you think of marijuana consumption? With our marijuana
                edibles, smoking pot will become a thing of the past. Buy marijuana edibles from us and let some
                GMO-free yummies appeal to your sophisticated palate. In most cases, they are more potent than
                pre-rolled joints and proven to be a much safer way of consumption. From now on, you can say goodbye to
                being wreathed in the clouds of smoke! As an avid fan, you probably imagine how you’re rolling a joint
                and taking a drag. The point is that enjoying the relieving effects of cannabis and satisfying food
                cravings are no longer mutually exclusive. These days, however, you can avoid inhaling the smoke and
                experiencing those hard throat hits. Our weed edibles are mouth-watering snacks and drinks that not only
                keep you highly medicated but also let your taste buds run wild. So, if sitting in a haze of smoke when
                using cannabis is not for you, you won’t find anything better than the culinary delights offered by
                Med-Cabinet. If you are a non-smoker who is fed up with consuming cannabis in such a ‘traditional’ way,
                you are now on the verge of exploring something that you’ve been looking for.</div>
            <div class="info">The Science: So why would you use a CBD bath bomb?Our Our Relieve CBD Bath Bomb is the
                ultimate combination of essential oils for maximum pain relief. As you soak in the tub, your body
                absorbs the essential oils and the CBD, like a sponge. A cannabis bath bomb is a full-body topical
                application that allows for unparalleled all-over relief. Our nourishing Relieve bath bombs combine the
                power of organic essential oils and cannabinoids to create effect-specific full-body experiences. The
                Entourage Effect occurs when you combine cannabinoids with terpenes/essential oils. How it works: Our
                Relieve cannabis bath bombs were created with the Entourage Effect in mind. Your skin is your largest
                organ and is a powerful tool for absorbing cannabinoids and balancing your endocannabinoid system. We
                carefully selected each oil to support the relief of sore muscles and aching bones while also lifting
                away the stress and offering mental clarity. These powerful molecules work together with your
                endocannabinod system creating a synergistic effect. Each blend is more than a scent, it is an
                experience.</div>
            <div class="info">Our Releaf Balm is a concentrated whole plant cannabis-infused salve that relaxes and
                calms your body. Using full spectrum CBD provides all of the cannbinoids and plant matter in the
                cannabis plant to allow for optimal effects. Our Releaf Balms use full spectrum CBD. Products with
                ‘Broad Spectrum CBD’ only contain CBD in isolate or distillate form, and none of the other beneficial
                cannabinoids or plant matter that can provide benefits. Releaf Balm is available in 15 ML and 50 ML
                sizes. This cannabinoid-rich balm is plant-based and powerful on pain. The balm is made with nourishing
                organic oils such as eucalyptus, tea tree, peppermint, and lavender. Made from the whole plant with
                all-natural ingredients, our targeted topical formula won’t irritate sensitive skin, and will address
                inflammation and chronic pain. It’s non-intoxicating, so it won’t make you feel high — it’s applied
                directly to skin and simply works to relieve pain and discomfort. Experience a soothing scent and
                activated warmth followed by a cooling sensation. Apply balm liberally and gently massage over the
                affected area until completely absorbed. Store in a cool to room temperature setting and keep away from
                direct sunlight. Repeat 3 or more times daily as needed. Consult your doctor if irritation develops.

        <div class="disclaimer">
            FDA Disclaimer:
            <br>
            <br>FDA has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of the drug substance cannabidiol (CBD) for
            the
            treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age
            and older. That means FDA has concluded that this particular drug product is safe and effective for its
            intended use.
            <br>
            <br>The agency also has approved Marinol and Syndros for therapeutic uses in the United States, including
            for
            nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy and for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in
            AIDS patients. Marinol and Syndros include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9-
            tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is considered the psychoactive intoxicating component of cannabis (i.e.,
            the component responsible for the “high” people may experience from using cannabis). Another FDA-approved
            drug, Cesamet, contains the active ingredient nabilone, which has a chemical structure similar to THC and is
            synthetically derived. Cesamet, like dronabinol-containing products, is indicated for nausea associated with
            cancer chemotherapy.
            <br>
            <br>FDA is aware that unapproved cannabis and/or unapproved cannabis-derived products are being used to
            treat a
            number of medical conditions including, AIDS wasting, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, spasticity associated with
            multiple sclerosis, and cancer and chemotherapy-induced nausea. Caregivers and patients can be confident
            that FDA-approved drugs have been carefully evaluated for safety, efficacy, and quality, and are monitored
            by the FDA once they are on the market. However, the use of unapproved cannabis and cannabis-derived
            products can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, including serious safety risks. Also, there has
            been no FDA review of data from rigorous clinical trials to support that these unapproved products are safe
            and efficacious for the various therapeutic uses for which they are being used.
            <br>
            <br>FDA understands the need to develop therapies for patients with unmet medical needs, and does everything
            it
            can to facilitate this process. FDA has programs such as Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated
            Approval and Priority Review that are designed to facilitate the development of and expedite the approval of
            drug products. In addition, the FDA’s expanded access (sometimes called “compassionate use”) statutory and
            regulatory provisions are designed to facilitate the availability of investigational products to patients
            with serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy
            available, either because the patients have exhausted treatment with or are intolerant of approved
            therapies, or when the patients are not eligible for an ongoing clinical trial. Through these programs and
            the drug approval process, FDA supports sound, scientifically-based research into the medicinal uses of drug
            products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds and will continue to work with companies
            interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market.
